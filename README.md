Vertical Tabs for VSCode - Latest Version of Visual Studio Code

![Image of Vertical Tabs](vscode.jpg)

## why

I want to have vertical tabs in VSCode. Perfect for widescreen displays.

## how

VSCode is basically written with Web Technology. We can edit appearance with CSS. You need following extension to make changes persistent by importing a file:

**Custom CSS and JS Loader**

## what

Enable vertical tabs! Breadcrumbs are still visible and usable, Tabs are vertical organized, Editor Actions and Window Splitting is still possible! (In comparison to other CSS files I tried).

## target

This piece of CSS is written for current Version 1.37.1 of VSCode. I may adapt it to future versions. Feel free to fork it. I'd be happy to see a reference to my work if you do so.
